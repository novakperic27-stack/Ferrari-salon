Ferrari Barber Salon - Prijepolje
Code assistant
User
Create a modern, elegant and professional website for a men’s barber salon named “Ferrari” located in Prijepolje, Serbia.
The design must be inspired by Ferrari brand aesthetics – dominant colors should be Ferrari red, black, white and subtle metallic details. The website should feel luxury, precision, speed and class.
Include subtle Italian flag elements (green, white, red) integrated tastefully in the design (for example as small accents, dividers, or icons – not overwhelming).
The owner and head barber is Seid Jakupović – clearly highlight him as the main professional behind the brand, with a premium “Master Barber” presentation section.
Website structure:
Hero section with a bold headline, Ferrari-inspired typography, and a luxury barber image
About the Salon (story, values, precision, professionalism)
About the Owner / Head Barber – Seid Jakupović
Services & Pricing (clean, minimal layout)
Gallery (premium barbershop aesthetic)
Contact section with location (Prijepolje), phone number placeholder, and working hours
Design requirements:
Elegant, minimal, masculine and premium
Use modern fonts (luxury sans-serif or serif mix)
Smooth animations and transitions
Fully responsive (mobile-first)
Dark mode feel with red accents
Tone and branding:
Professional, confident, elite
Emphasize precision, style, discipline and high standards
Generate the full website layout and content text in Serbian language, but keep the design modern and international.

Convert this website layout and content into clean HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Use modern, semantic code and responsive design.

To satisfy your request, I will convert the existing React architecture into a high-performance, vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation. We will leverage Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling (as used in the original design) and modern ES6 JavaScript for dynamic content injection and scroll interactions.
Specification
Structural Update: The application will be refactored into a single-page semantic HTML structure within index.html, removing React component abstractions in favor of direct DOM elements.
Dynamic Content Injection: The SERVICES and GALLERY data will be moved into index.tsx. Upon page load, JavaScript will dynamically generate and inject these elements into their respective containers to maintain clean, manageable code.
Interaction Layer: Vanilla JavaScript will handle the navigation bar's state changes (transparency to solid on scroll) and smooth scroll behaviors.
Visual Fidelity: All Ferrari-inspired aesthetics, including the high-impact Hero typography, Italian flag accents, and the Master Barber presentation, will be preserved using pure Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS variables.

How can i publish this

To publish your Ferrari Barber Salon website, you have several world-class options that are free, fast, and professional. Since your project is built with modern web standards (HTML, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript/ESM), it is considered a Static Site.
Here are the best ways to get it live:
1. Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel is extremely fast and provides excellent performance for modern frontend apps.
Push your code to a GitHub repository.
Go to Vercel.com and sign up with GitHub.
Click "Add New" > "Project" and import your repository.
Vercel will automatically detect the settings. Click "Deploy".
You will get a your-site.vercel.app URL immediately, and you can easily connect a custom domain like ferraribarber.rs later.
2. Netlify
Very similar to Vercel and very popular among frontend engineers.
Connect your GitHub account to Netlify.com.
Select your repository.
Click "Deploy site".
Netlify provides a drag-and-drop feature if you don't want to use Git: just zip your project folder and drop it into their "Deploy" area.
3. GitHub Pages
If you already have your code on GitHub, this is the most integrated way.
Go to your repository Settings.
Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar.
Under "Build and deployment", ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected.
Select your main branch and /root folder, then click Save.
Professional Tips for your "Ferrari" Brand:
Custom Domain: To truly match the luxury aesthetic, purchase a domain name (e.g., .rs or .com). A "vercel.app" URL is great for testing, but a custom domain is essential for a "Ferrari" level of class.
SSL (HTTPS): All the services above provide free SSL certificates automatically, ensuring your site is secure (the "lock" icon in the browser).
Performance: Your current code uses CDN links for fonts and Tailwind. This is perfect for quick loading. For ultimate performance, these hosting providers will serve your images via global Edge networks (CDNs).
Which of these would you like to explore further? I can help you prepare the files specifically for any of these platforms.

To publish your Ferrari Barber Salon website and get it live on the internet, the most professional "next step" is to connect your code to Vercel via GitHub.
The Deployment Process
Create a GitHub Repository: Go to GitHub.com, create a new repository named ferrari-barber, and upload all your files there.
Connect to Vercel:
Open the Vercel dashboard on your browser (or use the app you installed).
Click "Add New" > "Project".
Select your GitHub repository.
Deploy: Vercel will recognize the project settings and put it online at a URL like ferrari-barber.vercel.app.
I have updated your files below to include the necessary configuration (package.json and vite.config.ts) so that Vercel knows exactly how to build and host your site. I also synchronized your index.tsx and index.html to ensure the React components render correctly.

How to create new repository

To create a new repository and get your Ferrari Barber Salon website live, follow these steps:
1. Create the Repository on GitHub
Sign in to GitHub: Go to GitHub.com on your computer (or your phone's browser in Desktop Mode).
Start New Repo: Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
Name it: Use something professional like ferrari-barber-salon.
Privacy: Set it to Public (so Vercel can see it easily).
Initialize: Do NOT check "Add a README file" or "Add .gitignore" for now. This makes the first upload simpler.
Create: Click the green "Create repository" button.
2. Upload Your Files
On the next screen (your new empty repo), look for the text: "Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file."
Click "uploading an existing file".
Drag and drop all the files from your project folder into the box.
Wait for them to upload, then click "Commit changes" at the bottom.
3. Connect to Vercel (Final Step)
Open your Vercel app or go to Vercel.com.
Click "Add New..." and select "Project".
It will ask you to connect your GitHub account. Do that.
Find your ferrari-barber-salon repo in the list and click "Import".
Click "Deploy".
Your site will be live in about 30 seconds!
I've made one small update to your index.html below. I removed the importmap because Vite (which is defined in your package.json) handles all those imports automatically during the build process on Vercel. This ensures the production version of your site is as fast and clean as possible.

Do i need to put some description in repository

Ran for 14s

Thought for 8 seconds
It is not strictly required for the website to work, but as a senior engineer, I highly recommend adding one. It makes the project look professional on GitHub and helps with Google search results (SEO).
Here is a professional description you can copy and paste:
Ferrari Barber Salon Prijepolje – Premium muški salon i Master Barber Seid Jakupović. Luksuzan vebsajt inspirisan Ferrari estetikom, fokusiran na preciznost, stil i vrhunsku mušku negu.
Why add a description?
Professionalism: When you share the link on social media (Instagram, WhatsApp), the description will appear as a nice preview under the link.
SEO: It helps people in Prijepolje find the salon when they search on Google.
Tags: I also recommend adding "Topics" (tags) to your repo: barbershop, prijepolje, ferrari, react, luxury.
One final check for your files
In the "Existing Files" list you provided, your index.html still contains a <script type="importmap">. Since you are using Vite (as seen in your package.json), you should remove that block to avoid errors during the Vercel build.
I have cleaned it up for you here. Use this version of index.html when you upload to GitHub:
index.html
check_circle
Next steps for you:
Upload all files (including the components folder) to your new GitHub repo.
Go to Vercel, import the repo, and hit Deploy.
Let me know if you run into any errors during the upload!

Where do i get files from

To get your files onto your computer so you can upload them to GitHub, you need to manually create them. There isn't a "download" button, so you will create a folder on your computer and save each piece of code into a file.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Create a Folder: Create a new folder on your computer named ferrari-barber.
Create the Sub-folder: Inside that folder, create another folder named components.
Create the Files:
Open a text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code).
Copy the code for a file (like index.tsx).
Paste it into the editor.
Save As using the exact name (e.g., index.tsx). Crucial: Ensure the file extension is .tsx, .ts, .html, or .json—not .txt.
Organize:
Put the main files (index.html, index.tsx, App.tsx, package.json, etc.) in the root folder.
Put all the files starting with components/ (like Navbar.tsx) inside the components folder.
I have updated and consolidated all the files below into their final, "ready-to-deploy" state. Use these versions for your upload:
