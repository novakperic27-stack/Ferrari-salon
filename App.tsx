Create a Folder: Create a new folder on your computer named ferrari-barber.
Create the Sub-folder: Inside that folder, create another folder named components.
Create the Files:
Open a text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code).
Copy the code for a file (like index.tsx).
Paste it into the editor.
Save As using the exact name (e.g., index.tsx). Crucial: Ensure the file extension is .tsx, .ts, .html, or .json—not .txt.
Organize:
Put the main files (index.html, index.tsx, App.tsx, package.json, etc.) in the root folder.
Put all the files starting with components/ (like Navbar.tsx) inside the components folder.
I have updated and consolidated all the files below into their final, "ready-to-deploy" state. Use these versions for your upload:
package.json
